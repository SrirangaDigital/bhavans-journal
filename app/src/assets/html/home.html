					<p>The Period of the first thirteen years of the twenty-first century has seen that the information available to mankind had become double that of all the information that was available to it during the whole of the twentieth century. While this awesome increase has enabled people to upgrade and fine-tune facilities and comforts at the physical level, in terms of meaningful existence, purpose, contentment, tranquility and peace of mind, we seem to have taken quite a few steps backwards.</p>
					<p>Bhavan itself was founded by Dr. K. M. Munshi  because he was concerned with changes that were perceptible, seventy-five years ago which prompted him to establish it for resuscitation and propagation of culture and ethical values. We find that there is greater need for an institution like Bhavan now, more than ever before. While Bhavan has grown and expanded, it has to intensify its efforts now to a much greater extent and it is doing so.</p>
					<p>Among the various vehicles which Bhavan employs to carry forward its mission are its books, publication and periodicals. The most important and effective among them is its English fortnightly, BHAVANS JOURNAL, which also maintains principles of ethical journalism.</p>
					<p>The contents of its issues, from its very first issue onwards, are of relevance at all times unlike in the case of other periodicals which are of interest to people only till the arrival of their subsequent issues. A hundred years from now, contents of issues of Bhavan's Journal however, will remain to be of interest and relevance.</p>
					<p>I am very happy, therefore, that Bhavan's Mysore Kendra has taken the initiative to bring out collections of issues of Bhavan's Journal from its first issue in the form a CD. I am quite sure that it will find itself to be a well sought after source of knowledge for eternally relevant values and culture.</p>

					<p>Kulapati Dr. K. M. Munshiji’s three outstanding contributions cannot be surpassed. They are founding Bharatiya Vidya Bhavan worldwide, publication of Bhavan’s Journal and publication of Bhavan’s Book University Series covering plethora of Indian History and Culture. Today Vidya Bhavan has branches all over the country and even some abroad. In addition Kulapati has established many other milestones such as serving as a prominent member of the committee which drafted the constitution of India and playing a major role in merging the unwilling princely state of Hyderabad with India, as stated in his book <strong>The End of an Era.</strong> Bhavan’s Journal has readers all over the world. Perhaps this is the only journal serving the cause of Indian culture in all its aspects. It contains articles written by many stalwarts of our country including Kulapati Dr. K. M. Munshi, C. Rajagopalachari (Rajaji), S. Radhakrishnan, Union Minister C. Subramaniam, V. Shivarama Krishnanan, Dr. B. M. Hegde, and a host of great scholars and savants. Started in 1954, Bhavan’s Journal contains excellent articles with good illustrations. Excerpts from Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru’s <strong>Discovery of India,</strong> Kulapati’s <strong>Jaya Somanatha</strong> etc are only examples to this. Bhavan being an apolitical organization, its Journal follows the same principle. <strong>Vasudhaiva Kutumbakam</strong> is its motto. Bhavan’s Journal has a continuity which is unprecedented in the history of cultural journalism.</p>
					<p>Many ardent lovers of Indian History and Culture, always sought their required information in the past issues of Bhavan’s Journal. Hence there was a need to consolidate all the articles of Bhavan’s Journal in one place. Also, it was felt that this should be made available world over with easily carrying discs.</p>
					<p>Digitisation is the trend all over the world including our own country. Noting this modern trend it was proposed to digitize all the issues of Bhavan’s Journal from 1954 to 2016. This is sponsored by M. P. Birla Institute of Management, Bengaluru and Bhavan’s Priyamvada Birla Institute of Management, Mysuru to help and encourage readers all over the world.</p>
					<p>A work of this huge magnitude naturally requires participation and support from many scholars. At the outset we are grateful to the authorities of Bharatiya Vidya Bhavan, Mumbai, Head office who gave us permission and support. In this connection first and foremost we should express our gratefulness to Sri Surendralal G. Mehta, President, BVB, Mumbai for his blessings in the form of a Preface, and to Sri I. R. Khandwala (Hon. Treasurer and Trustee), Sri H. N. Dastur, (Executive Secretary and Director General), Sri P. N. Santhanagopal, (Director, and Editor – Bhavan’s Journal) and Sri V. V. Bhaskaran (Director – BVB, Mumbai).</p>
					<p>But for Sri P. V. Sankarankutty, Joint Director, BVB, who took personal interest at every stage, this task would not have been possible. Our special thanks to Sri K. N. Ramaswamy, (Director – Projects, Programmes and Publication, Chennai) and Sri Ashok Pradhan (Director, New Delhi BVB) for providing us with the back issues of Bhavan’s Journal which helped us in completing the whole project successfully. </p>
					<p>Our sincere thanks are due to Dr. N. S. Viswanath (Director, MPBIM), Sri Sudhindra Gargesa (Deputy Director, MPBIM), Prof. K. L. Ramadas (Deputy Director, MPBIM), Dr. A. T. Bhashyam (Director, BPBIM).</p>
					<p>We should express our gratefulness to Sri Arjun of Sriranga Digital, Mysuru, who has taken up this digitization work on a top priority basis. The Digital Archives covers 63 years (1954 – 2016) of Bhavan’s Journal, with 1551 issues, 32293 articles, 4465 authors and 1,68,217 pages. Perhaps this may be a record for a work of this type. This can be searched based on years of publication, titles of the articles, authors, features and series. The search can be done on key words. For example when we refer to Buddhism, automatically articles based upon Ashoka come up; when the Indian freedom movement is referred to the names of savants like Mahatma Gandhi, Pandit Nehru, Sardar Patel and others come up. The activities of different Kendras of Bhavan are reflected in the section; Bhavan’s News and gives us a glimpse into the activities of different Kendras of BVB.</p>
					<p>Finally we are grateful to all others who have helped us in making this project a great success.</p>
